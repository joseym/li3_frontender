# Assets Plugin for [li3](http://lithify.me)

***

> This is my second draft of an Assets plugin for Lithium PHP. The first was a great learning experiance but I've decided there are a number of things I would change.

***

This Plugin now uses the awesome [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic) library to power many of it's features.

## Original Project

> This is a branch off of my [original assets plugin ("li3_frontender")](https://github.com/joseym/li3_frontender/tree/legacy)(legacy branch)
> If you would like to use the old version, you can clone it from there.

## Installation
There are several ways to grab and use this project:

### Use Composer
__Best Option (default)__

> Other install options require a configuration parameter be set in `Libraries::add()`
> [More on that later](https://github.com/joseym/li3_frontender#configuration-options).

Modify your projects `composer.json` file

~~~ json
{
    "require": {
    	...
        "joseym/li3_frontender": "master"
        ...
    }
}
~~~

Run `php composer.phar install` (or `php composer.phar update`) and, aside from adding it to your Libraries, you should be good to go.

> __Notice:__ LessPHP does not currently provide a composer package, therefore I have branched the project and have submitted my own package until such time as [Leafo decides to adopt composer](https://github.com/leafo/lessphp/issues/216).
> I will do my best to keep it up to date with the primary project.

### Load via Submodule
__More manual, bleh. Seriously, Composer is awesome__

> This option requires that you tell the plugin you are not using `composer`.
> [See library option (`source`)](https://github.com/joseym/li3_frontender#configuration-options)

1. Clone/Download the plugin into your app's ``libraries`` directory.
2. Tell your app to load the plugin by adding the following to your app's ``config/bootstrap/libraries.php``:

	Libraries::add('li3_frontender', array('source' => 'submodule'));

	> Important to set the source to something else as 'composer'.
	> Configuration options are available, standby

3. Pull in the the project dependencies.

> Currently dependancies include [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic#readme), [Symfony/Process](https://github.com/symfony/Process#readme) and [LessPHP](https://github.com/leafo/lessphp#readme).

	$ cd app/libraries/li3_frontender
	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update


## Usage

> If you use coffee script you will have to ensure [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://http://coffeescript.org) are running on your server.

This project also comes packaged with [YUI Compressor](http://yuilibrary.com/download/yuicompressor/), which Assetic uses for compression of JS and CSS assets.

Currently this project supports the following frontend tools:

1. LessCSS compiling
2. CoffeeScript compiling
3. Instant cache busting thru unique filenames
4. CSS/JS Compression

The project comes bundled with it's own [Helper](https://github.com/joseym/li3_frontender/blob/assetic/extensions/helper/Assets.php), here's how use use it.

### Linking Stylesheets
You assign page styles much like you would with the out-of-the-box Html helper

~~~ php
<?php $this->assets->style(array('main', 'menu', 'magic.less')); ?>
~~~

> You may have noticed the `.less` file in there. Adding the file extension is required for `.less` files to ensure they are compiled, you may include the `.css` extension for standard stylesheets or just leave it off.

### Linking Scripts
Like the style helper, the script helper also takes an array.

~~~ php
<?php $this->assets->script(array('plugins', 'common', 'niftythings.coffee')); ?>
~~~

> Just like the `.less` file in the last example, if you pass a `.coffee` file to the script helper the plugin will compile it and serve up the proper, compiled, js. All other files are assumed `.js`. Feel free to add `.js` to these extensions if you would like.

## Production vs Development

> The backend of this plugin will do its best to determine if you're in a dev environment or production, if you're in a production environment this plugin will automatically compress your stylesheets and scripts and merge them into a single file and serve __that__ file up to your layout or view.

This option, and several others are overwriteable from the `Libraries::add()` configuration. Here's an example

~~~ php
<?php
	Libraries::add('li3_frontender', array(
		'compress' => false,
		'production' => true,
		'assets_root' => LITHIUM_APP_PATH . "/webroot/assets",
		'locations' => array(
			'coffee' => '/usr/bin/libs/coffee',
			'node' => '/usr/bin/libs/node'
		),
		'source' => 'submodule',
		'cacheOnly' => true
	));
?>
~~~

### Configuration options

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Options</th>
		<th>Defaults</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>compress</strong></td>
		<td><code>bool</code> (true/false)</td>
		<td><code>false<strong></td>
		<td>Force assets to be compressed, if production this defaults to <code>true</code>, otherwise <code>false</code>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>production</strong></td>
		<td><code>bool</code> (true/false)</td>
		<td>attempts to read from Lithium Environments class</td>
		<td>Force assets to render in production or not, if this isn't set then the plugin will attempt to determine this automagically.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>assets_root</strong></td>
		<td>Pass in a path to your assets</td>
		<td><code>LITHIUM_APP_PATH . "/webroot"</code></td>
		<td>Where should the plugin look for your files, defaults to the standard <code>webroot</code> directory. The example above would look for CSS files in <code>/webroot/assets/css/</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>locations</strong></td>
		<td>array: <code>coffee</code> - <em>path to coffeescript on server</em><br /><code>node</code> - <em>path to node on server</em></td>
		<td><code>coffee</code> - <code>/usr/bin/coffee</code><br /><code>node</code> - <code>/usr/bin/node</code></td>
		<td>These are the locations of <code>node</code> and <code>coffeescript</code> on your server, defaults should suffice.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>source</strong></td>
		<td>string: <code>composer</code><br /><code>submodule</code></td>
		<td><code>composer</code></td>
		<td>
			This determines where the library will pull dependency libraries, composer uses vendor paths in
			`libraries/_source` whereas submodule loads librarys within this plugin `libraries/li3_frontender/libraries`.
			Normally you only need to set this option if you do not install this plugin via composer.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>cacheOnly</strong></td>
		<td>boolean</td>
		<td><code>false<code></td>
		<td>
			If true, will display a 404 if the assets could not be read from cache. For some plugins, such as
			`li3_docs` this will result in not being able to load the css contained in the plugin.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>manifests</strong></td>
		<td>array</td>
		<td><code>null<code></td>
		<td>
			If set, you can specify assets in named lists in the config, then reference them from the helper by name. See below.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Manifests

Use asset manifests if you wish to specify your assets in the library config rather than in the view.

First, specify the manifest like this (below, "main" is the name of a manifest for JavaScript files):

~~~ php
<?php
	Libraries::add('li3_frontender', array(
		'manifests' => array(
			'js' => array(
				'main' => array(
					'main.coffee',
					'popup.js'
				)
			)
		)
	));
?>
~~~

Then, reference the manifest by name when calling the helper:

~~~ php
<?php $this->assets->script('main'); ?>
~~~
